# Semi-Supervised Crowd Counting with Contextual Modeling: Facilitating Holistic Understanding of Crowd Scenes

The list of images in the validation set for UCF-QNRF is the same with that in [BL](https://github.com/ZhihengCV/Bayesian-Crowd-Counting). I will update the preprocess code later. Please set the learning rate to 2e-5 when training on QNRF if you want to reproduce the result. You should be able to reproduce our implementation on Google Colab for SHA.

Some more details will be provided later
