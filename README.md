# Semi-Supervised Crowd Counting with Contextual Modeling: Facilitating Holistic Understanding of Crowd Scenes

The list of images in the validation set for UCF-QNRF is the same as that in [BL](https://github.com/ZhihengCV/Bayesian-Crowd-Counting). Please set the learning rate to 2e-5, weight decay to 4e-5 when training on QNRF. 

Some more details will be provided later
